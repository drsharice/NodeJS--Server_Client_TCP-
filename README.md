The TCP server and client applications are written in Node.js.
The application is devised for the Client to send encrypted data under via a dedicated TCP Port to the server.
The data should be under 1000 bytes after it is encrypted.
The server in return will encrypt the message and send the plain text back to the client.
All communication will recieve a time stamp.
In order to start the application you must open a terminal and start the server. js first and then open a differnt terminal and start the client.js file.
